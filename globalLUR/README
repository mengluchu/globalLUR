### GlobalLUR is the R package for auxilary functions used in the project "Statistical method of global air pollution modeling"
  
```
install_github("mengluchu/globalLUR/globalLUR/globalLUR") 
library(globalLUR)
ls("package:globalLUR")
```
functions include:
- removedips
remove stations that have time series points less than a certain percentage (by default 15%).

- error_matrix 
calculating RMSE, MAE, IQR
  
- subset_grep
Subsetting a dataframe using grep style strings.

- ppm2ug 
converting NO2 from ppm to ug/m3
 
- sampledf
creating training and test dataset, and remove the variables that are not needed. 

- mergeraster2file
merge raster file to the dataframe


- "Mechanical"
a novel method developed for air pollution modeling with an attempt to integrating air distribution mechanisms. 

- "xboost_..", "Brt_..", "rf_..", "Lasso", "cforest_..", "ctree_..",   
wrapping functions created for calculating error matrix and importance variables, when applicable.
